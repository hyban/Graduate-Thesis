  Abstract                 = {Diffusion theory has been a useful and frequently applied analytical method to study the transport of light in random media. The diffusion equation requires unphysical boundary conditions. This is reflected in the fact that the diffusion solution must differ from the exact solution in a boundary region a few mean free paths thick. Exact transport theory indicates that for particle diffusion the true boundary is to be replaced by an extrapolated boundary 0.71 transport mean free paths outside of it. This is the number that has universally been used in treating light diffusion, although it is sometimes neglected because it is often a very short distance. However, because there is reflection at the boundary due to mismatch in the index of refraction, the extrapolation distance for diffusion of light is longer than that for particles, and this must be taken into account. The correction is large, even for modest indices of refraction. We show here that the appropriate boundary condition is given in terms of an extrapolation distance and tabulate this quantity as a function of relative scattering probability and index of refraction of the medium.},

  Abstract                 = {In connection with recent work on remote imaging of random media by light, a straightforward generalization of the proper diffusion boundary conditions is presented that takes into account Fresnel reflection. The Milne problem at exterior boundaries is solved for various values of index of refraction, absorption, and scattering anisotropy parameters to yield extrapolated end points and extrapolation distances. A generalized interface condition is derived to replace the usual condition of continuity of intensity. Benchmark-quality numerical results are given for the extrapolation distance and for the new index-dependent parameter in the interface conditions. Difficulties in using the extrapolated end point when the index is sufficiently large are discussed, and a new image procedure suitable for this case is presented.},
